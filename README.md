# skawtch => droink

ruby project aimed at providing a modern framework for creating drinks.

## Current focus

the current focus of this project is to make a mobile app which enabled the user to quickly and efficiently store and lookup myriad 'droinks'.  a droink can be created, modified, destroyed, and shared via social media. :v: :eyes:

## Future vision

in the future, droink will enable its users to collaborate with peers nearby, as well as online in distant locations, and mix their own custom drinks and share with the entire world.

### How will this happen?

this is just a side project of mine, a hobby if you will.  the larger overall vision of skawtch is to provide libraries to enhance user's everyday life.  if this app seems to have that effect as it begins to take shape, it may shift into more of a primary focus instead of a hobby.

### What can i do to help?

if you find this type of app particularly interesting or useful, leave a comment or suggestion for me.  if you have a specific feature you would like to request, do that too! there is no limit to what we can create together :art:, so let's push the envelope :envelope: a little bit and see what we come up with :busts_in_silhouette:!

***

that's all there is for now.  please check back often, as i plan to update this project fairly frequently in the near future.

cheers!
